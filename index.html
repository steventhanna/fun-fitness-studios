          1960? Most people are, if you’re in the gym banging out sets on a bench, or if today is legs day, then in the immortal words of celebrity comedian Jeff Foxworthy, “You might be a Neanderthal-neck.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Long gone are the days of chest, back, &amp; arms! Today, unlike the mid 60s, we know that muscle isolation is great for bodybuilding, but doesn’t do much for core strength. Even if you’re skeptical about change, consider the time you spend with your current workout. How much time do you dedicate to cardio, &amp; weights? Before the days of microwaves and twitter accounts things were simpler, slower. Today, there’s barely enough time to accomplish daily task despite our modern conveniences, and if you’re reading this page, you face the same challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now do something about it. FUN FITNESS workouts are designed to consolidate your time and maximize your effort! Are you looking to lose weight or gain muscle? The only way to do either or both is diet and exercise! Dieting alone though won’t do much for you overall health other than to strip you of much needed nutrition. Our goal is to help you achieve optimal fitness without injury.

            Marcus Brent is an exceptional personal trainer who exhibits professionalism, enthusiasm and persistence in helping his clients attain the maximum results.  I’ve worked with Marcus since February 2007 and will continue to use his expertise. I have been around many personal trainers and Marcus takes a backseat to nobody. -- Bryan Harlan - Harlan Sports Management| Marcus has been a blessing that happened in our lives. My daughter and I are so lucky to have him as a trainer. His professional abilities went beyond my expectations. His knowledge in the field added by his caring and positive personality make him better then just a trainer. Thank you Marcus for being such a great trainer and for the friendship developed from it. -- Stella Bittencourt-Hills - Chicago, IL| Marcus Brent of F.U.N. FITNESS STUDIO is more than just another personal trainer. For years I struggled with weight problems, after having children in my late 30’s it was very difficult to get the weight off. I tried going to the health club, I tried dieting. I wasn’t successful in either. Now I know it was because I didn’t understand that I had to do both. And in my case, the weight was going to take a while. F.U.N. FITNESS STUDIO showed me how to burn more calories and fat then I had on my own. I didn’t know what core training was, but now I have a stronger core. On days when I wanted to give up, I was able to call Marcus, and he helped me push forward. F.U.N. FITNESS STUDIO has been the best thing that has happened to me. I have reached my personal goal and now I am eating and looking better than I have in years. And I know I’m a lot healthier. I have referred F.U.N. FITNESS STUDIO to my friends.  Marcus, Thank you so much for all of you help -- Paris| Marcus comes to our house and works out both my wife and me separately. He is able to create individual workouts that meet each of our unique needs. Marcus is always mixing things up to make each session fresh and interesting. He helps us get the maximum benefit out of the limited time my wife and I have to exercise -- Dan & Alyson Margulies | I had our 3rd baby February 15th and understand wanting to get back into shape. Marcus is great. He really took time to understand my history before moving forward with our training program. I greatly recommend him. After your wife goes in for her 6 week postpartum visit and her doctor clears her for exercise, I would definitely suggest a trainer to jump start her exercise routine. Marcus is on time, highly energetic, provides a customized program, communicates wonderfully through email and otherwise, and all around really good at what he does. I have a herniated disc and is very cognoscente of the injury in my workout -- Sheryl Bellick - Chicago, IL
